# Xtreme Mappers

Our aim is to minimize the environmental effects due to construction of new buildiings by calculating the impact on the surrounding environment due to construction of buildiing. 

We take in account the following factors:
- Air Quality index
- Deth of Building (PM-10 Releasees due to digging of earth)
- Height of the buildiing (Change in wind speed)
- The vehical density of that area after the construction
- etc.



## Features

- Interactive map input

- Display the current environmental situation using a ESS(environmental sustainablilty score) factor

- Slecting the construction type (Commercial, Factory, Apartment or Tenament).

- Calculates the total carbon emissions for different fuels from the below dataset

-Display the current environmental condition of the area

-Takes in various factors, catagorises the construction under a catagory and outputs various factors which affect the environment

- Displays the long term impacts on environment after construction.

- We also provide an Environmental sustainablilty report demo report 
- Report1: https://github.com/Jay-1409/Storage/blob/ca19018f0f0f54c1c1f5eb7a57b037a0b4e065fe/ESS_Report%20(6).pdf
- Report2 : https://github.com/Jay-1409/Storage/blob/bacf1ff2bfc9526685900996c717b15b4b9fa53f/Environmental_Sustainability_Report_(12)%5B1%5D.pdf
- The environmental sustainablilty report helps one understand how much impect their construction does on the environment and stepes to mitigate/compansate these changes.
